# Hacking-Lifecycle-Simulation-Project

### Project description：
Based on the book “A Hacker's Mind”, developed a simulation of the complete life cycle of hacking project. Through diagrams and code to show the way from vulnerability discovery to the system repair the whole process.

### Project Components：
**Lifecycle Diagram:** Created a “Hacking Lifecycle Diagram” to visualize the relationship and flow of the 8 attack and defense phases.

**Simulation Code:** Implemented a complete attack lifecycle simulation in Python, including the stages of vulnerability discovery, analysis, and exploitation.

**Attack and Defense Timeline Analysis:** The timeline clearly shows the whole process of vulnerability from discovery, attack to defense, making it easy to understand the sequence of events and response timing.
**Distribution of Vulnerability Types:** Pie chart showing the distribution of the two vulnerability types in the dataset.

### Implementation process：
- Through the class HackingLifecycle to simulate the entire attack and defense process.
- Each stage has a corresponding method implementation
- Use random numbers to simulate different attack scenarios
- Provide detailed process output

### Running results：
The code run will show the complete attack and defense process, including.
- Vulnerability discovery and analysis.
- Defense detection and response
- Patch development and countermeasures
